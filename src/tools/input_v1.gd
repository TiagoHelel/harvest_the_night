extends "res://src/tools/input_check.gd"

## The input paths of version 1.0: real clicks and real keys through the real
## scenes, with nobody in the room.
##
## Run by `python tools/verify.py`. The last line it prints is
## `N cases, M failed`, and it exits non-zero when M is not zero.
##
## **Every case from task 0112 on lives here.** `input_check` holds the MVP's
## 61 cases (tasks 0011-0111) and was already spending some 74 of the 120
## seconds verify gives a script when the 1.0 backlog was queued. Nothing moved
## across: the old cases stay where they are and this file starts with one.
##
## ## How it shares the old harness
##
## **It extends `input_check.gd`** rather than copying it. Every tree helper -
## `open_scene`, `until`, `click_control`, `tap_key`, `hold_key`, `expect` and
## the rest - needs the running SceneTree and the scene this run opened, and an
## inherited method has both without being handed them. What is overridden is
## everything that counts: `_run()` calls only the cases below, `_finish()`
## compares against `V1_CASES` and prints this file's own last line, and the
## watchdog names this file. Each suite is its own process, so `passed`,
## `failed` and `_completed` are this run's alone - the two counters never
## meet. `V1_CASES` rather than `CASES` because GDScript will not let a class
## declare a constant its parent already has.
##
## A plain helper that does not need the tree is shared through `SuiteKit`
## (`src/tools/suite_kit.gd`), never copied.
##
## **Defences are put down by night.** From task 0132 the rules refuse to
## place, upgrade or sell a defence by day; a case that needs one does it in
## PREPARATION - the way task 0119 moves the old suites - never by day.
##
## The stall watchdog is the parent's `WATCHDOG_SECONDS` (20 s without an
## assert landing), and every `expect()` puts it back to zero.

## How many `_case_NNNN_*` functions `_run()` is expected to finish.
## **Adding a case means bumping this.**
