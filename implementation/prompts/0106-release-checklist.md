# 0106 - The release checklist

- **Phase:** 8 - Ship the MVP
- **Status:** todo
- **Depends on:** 0105, 0099
- **Likely files:** implementation/RELEASE.md

## Goal

The list you run before publishing, written once, so nothing is remembered at the wrong moment.

## Requirements

- Every check with its command: verify, exports, save compatibility, the i18n checker, the perf budget, both builds smoke-tested
- Version bump, changelog, and a tag
- A known-issues section that is honest
- A rollback plan in one paragraph
- Run it once, end to end, and fix what it finds

## Done when

- [ ] Running the list top to bottom produces a publishable build
- [ ] The journal records what the first run of it found, because it will find something
- [ ] `python tools/verify.py` prints PASS
- [ ] the determinism hash is unchanged, or the change is deliberate and both
      the old and the new number are in the journal

## House rules

`src/core/` holds the game rules: node-free, deterministic, advanced only by
`Sim.tick()` at a fixed rate. No nodes, no unseeded randomness, no clock reads,
no iterating an unordered Dictionary without sorting the keys first. `src/ui/`
draws and reads input and owns no rules.

Every number a designer might want to turn lives in `src/core/game_data.gd`
with `# LEVER` on it. A new rule ships with an assert in
`src/tools/headless_check.gd` and a new input path with a case in
`src/tools/input_check.gd` - same pass, not later.

Code, identifiers, comments and every player-facing string are in English.
Art is generated from ASCII maps in `tools/gen_sprites.py`: do not hand-author
PNGs, edit the map and regenerate.

`design.md` is the source of truth for intent and `docs/reference-sheet.png`
for the look. If this task contradicts either, follow the task and say so in
the journal.
