# Progress journal - HARVEST THE NIGHT

Append-only, newest last. One entry per backlog task, written by the runner loop
in `prompts/00-RUNNER-LOOP.md` as step 5.

The format:

## 0042 - The shooting tower - done 2026-09-27

What changed: two or three sentences, in plain language.
Files: src/core/towers.gd, src/core/game_data.gd
Verify: 96 headless / 21 input / hash 1873912198 unchanged
Notes: anything the next session needs to know. Follow-ups worth a new task.
```

A task that could not be finished gets the same entry with `- blocked`, what was
tried, and exactly what decision or asset it is waiting on.

**Write down the hash whenever it moves**, with the old number and the new one,
and why the rule changed. That line is the only record of a deliberate balance
change, and `tools/determinism_hash.txt` on its own cannot tell you which of
forty commits moved it.

## 0000 - The backlog itself - done 2026-09-27

What changed: turned `design.md` and `docs/reference-sheet.png` into a 108-task
backlog with the same harness as the welcome_back_hero repository - generated
prompts, a Status line per task, a generated checkbox index, a bootstrap
`verify.py` that skips what the backlog has not built yet, and a loop driver.

Files: tools/backlog/part1-4.py, tools/gen_backlog.py, tools/task.py,
tools/verify.py, implementation/, .claude/commands/next-task.md

Verify: PASS - 2 passed, 5 skipped (everything Godot waits on task 0001).

Notes: the repository has no Godot project yet; task 0001 creates it. Decisions
baked into the backlog and worth knowing before changing them:

- **480x270 at 16px tiles**, integer scaling only. The farm is 40x18 tiles,
  which is the design document's "1.2 to 1.5 screens wide, one tall".
- **One fixed 30Hz tick** advances day growth, night combat, the headless
  tests, the 2x button and skipping a night. That single decision is what makes
  the determinism guard, the autoplayer and the skip-the-night feature possible
  at all; task 0055 is its acceptance test.
- **A flow field from the house**, not A* per zombie. Cheap, deterministic, and
  it holds a hundred of them with walls being built and destroyed underneath.
- **The reference sheet is wider than the design document.** The sheet shows a
  mortar, an auto-crossbow, mines, gunpowder, meat and energy, and nights up to
  20. The backlog follows the sheet for content and the document for scope: ten
  authored nights, with endless as an off-path extra at 0070.
- **Everything in English.** pt-BR is a translation file at task 0097, not a
  hardcoded string anywhere before it.

## 0001 - Godot project scaffold - done 2026-09-27

What changed: the repository is a Godot 4.7 project. `project.godot` at
480x270 with integer scaling and `gl_compatibility`, `scenes/Main.tscn` booting
to a screen that names the build, the six source directories each with a README
saying what belongs in it, and export presets for Windows and Web.

Files: project.godot, scenes/Main.tscn, src/ui/main.gd, src/core/build_info.gd,
export_presets.cfg, src/{core,ui,tools}/README.md, scenes/README.md,
sprites/README.md, assets/README.md, tools/verify.py

Verify: PASS - 3 passed, 4 skipped. `--import` exits 0, booting for 90 frames
prints the build line with no error or warning, and the boot screen renders
correctly at 480x270 (looked at it, not just asserted it).

Notes:

- **The exports could not be run: this machine has no Godot export templates.**
  `%APPDATA%/Godot/export_templates/` exists and is empty, so every export fails
  with the same unhelpful error. The presets themselves are written and correct.
  `verify.py` now detects this and prints SKIP naming the fix - Editor > Manage
  Export Templates > Download - rather than failing a build that is not broken.
  That is a deviation from this task's "both exports produce a file in build/",
  and it is an environment fix rather than a code one. It has to be resolved
  before **0100 - Exports**, which is where it actually matters.
- `build_info.gd` is a `RefCounted` with constants rather than an autoload, so
  `src/core/` stays node-free from the first file in it. Read it as
  `BuildInfo.VERSION`.
- Two small fixes to the bootstrap `verify.py` while it was in front of me: the
  export check now takes each preset's own `export_path` from the cfg instead of
  inventing one, and `godot import` no longer prints the importer's chatter on a
  pass.
- `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` and the first commits already existed from the
  backlog session, so the "git init" requirement was already satisfied.
